                <h3>Snake Game üêç </h3>
                <p>The famous snake game is an arcade one player maze game which i created by in python turtle which is
                    a Python library where its used to create graphics, pictures, and games. this was fun and
                    interactive way to expand my knowledge into the world of the python language. where i taught my self
                    many key concepts and different categories of functionality in libraries to interact with and help
                    with daily activties. (e.g, pomodoro technique, Weight Converter(tkinter), Habit Tracker, Email
                    Slicer,Unique password generator. ect </p>
                <h4><u>Background for Snake Game</u></h4>
                <p>
                    This was created and distributed by Sega in October 1976. It is considered to be a skillful game and
                    has popularized among people for generations. The snake in the Snake game is controlled using the
                    four direction buttons relative to the direction it is headed in. The player‚Äôs objective in the game
                    is to achieve maximum points as possible by collecting food or fruits. The player loses once the
                    snake hits the wall or hits itself.</p>

                <h3>Ping Pong Gameüèì</h3>
                <p>Since high-school , I began playing table tennis all the more seriously. I'm currently in kind of a
                    dead zone, in which I can beat the vast majority who think of it as simply old game, however on the
                    flip side can't beat the individuals who think of it as a Olympic sport and play it religiously.
                    I've made a model in Python using the Turtle libarary to make the famous old pong game. </p>
                <h4><u>Background of Ping Pong</u></h4>

                <p>Pong is a table tennis‚Äìthemed arcade sports video game, featuring simple two-dimensional graphics,
                    manufactured by Atari and originally released in 1972. It was one of the earliest arcade video
                    games; it was created by Allan Alcorn as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder
                    Nolan Bushnell, but Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney were surprised by the quality of
                    Alcorn's work and decided to manufacture the game. Bushnell based the game's concept on an
                    electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, the first home video game console.</p>

                        future.This opportunity realy helped me develop my teamworking skills, tactical thinking
                        skills, Good Communication Skills, and the ability to
                        work well under pressure.</p>
